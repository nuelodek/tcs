{"data":{"about":"Read this now \ud83d\udc47\n\nYou may have browsed through hundreds of LinkedIn profiles before coming here, but you are now seeing the best!\n\nI've spent more than ten years polishing my talents in a variety of job functions, responsibilities, and organizations and have been able to acquire the necessary skill sets to get any creative job done. My ability to simplify complicated procedures into teachable curricula and to create a friendly learning environment for students and beneficiaries of the subjects I take was developed early in my career as a teacher. Today, I instruct 100s of students in poetry, digital marketing, cryptocurrency investing, and copywriting using my skills and experience.\n\nI gained a practical and meticulous understanding of various accounting software, the accounting process, and deeper insights into inventory control and budgeting thanks to the opportunity to work as an accountant at a supermarket. Working with an auditor during the audit process exposed me to the delicate financial minutiae that are the lifeblood of every firm, whether it is a large corporation or a small SME.\n\nMy ability to sell and persuade others to buy is not a matter of luck; rather, it is a result of demand from the companies I own and have worked for. Upping my game at every opportunity I get has enhanced my ability to develop incomparable deals, and services that are rich in value, and better marketing techniques with each customer or patron I get the chance to connect with and present my products or services.\n\nAt this point, a lot of people ask me what I can do for them or what services I can provide for them.\nTo put it simply, I present to the public 3 latent abilities:\n\n\ud83d\udccd My outstanding presentation and writing abilities: I have a lot of experience creating well-rounded, high-trending material. novels, articles, books, technical writing, recommendation letters, personal statements, long- and short-form marketing copy, and essays. You may find my many books by searching on Google for \"Emmanuel Odekunle Amazon\".\n\n\ud83d\udccd I assist Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in developing plans to rule the social media landscape. I am able to accomplish this since I was raised in the digital age and have a thorough understanding of various digital and social media platforms.\n\n\ud83d\udccd International admissions, scholarships, and remote employment: You may choose to continue your education overseas or find a remote position in\u00a0high-ranking countries. I'm always only a DM away.\n\nHere? That's fantastic!\n\nP.S: nuelodekunle20@gmail.com\nP.SS: WhatsApp + 2349151294786","certifications":[],"city":"Lagos","company":"Shortchase","company_domain":"dev.shortchase.com","company_employee_range":"2-10","company_industry":"Software Development","company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/shortchase","company_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFAP72VY_CLpg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1697716246939/shortchase_logo?e=1731542400&v=beta&t=AmLME8ZNpAAPAltDGDuNmJFZShbazawmYsUUpwkr9vo","company_website":"http://dev.shortchase.com","company_year_founded":2019,"connection_count":500,"country":"Nigeria","current_company_join_month":6,"current_company_join_year":2024,"educations":[{"activities":"Grade: 2nd Class (Upper Division)","date_range":"2013 - 2017","degree":"Bachelor's degree","end_month":"2017","end_year":"","field_of_study":"Economics","school":"University of Ilorin, Nigeria","school_id":"35589112","school_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/35589112/","school_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D0BAQFG_98U_U6dVg/company-logo_200_200/0/1685721874626/university_of_ilorin_ilorin_logo?e=1731542400&v=beta&t=LEkquCGcXtpG24Lqbz033VepzZ3n03LdVAEFCesWlvs","start_month":"2013","start_year":""},{"activities":"Grade: 4A's 2B's 2c's","date_range":"Jun 2006 - Jan 2012","degree":"West African Senior School Certificate Examination","end_month":"Jan","end_year":2012,"field_of_study":"Social Sciences","school":"Classic City High School","school_id":"4232565","school_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/4232565/","school_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFRd0m5Fgoucg/company-logo_200_200/0/1630590932584?e=1731542400&v=beta&t=V3sNuNQ67kDqB8w2G3dFtPL-Si_PDqHSwRCRyuoxkyA","start_month":"Jun","start_year":2006}],"email":"nuelodekunle20@gmail.com","experiences":[{"company":"Shortchase","company_id":"23767955","company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/23767955","company_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFAP72VY_CLpg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1697716246939/shortchase_logo?e=1731542400&v=beta&t=yDddO8Ye6Nx0AvUIcR1pjby7i8HVGmLVzDd2rLq_nMQ","date_range":"Jun 2024 - Present","description":"","duration":"3 mos","end_month":"","end_year":"","is_current":true,"job_type":"Full-time","location":"Sagamu, Ogun State, Nigeria \u00b7 On-site","skills":"Computer Science","start_month":6,"start_year":2024,"title":"Back End Developer (Node.js RestfulAPIs and Express)"},{"company":"Gegeto Edtech ","company_id":"76095222","company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/76095222","company_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQGCcJmk63DyjA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630520060280?e=1731542400&v=beta&t=kGzVpNrBWcmnRJzAM9rT-13TZVKYgJunlp4ROVKawas","date_range":"Jun 2024 - Present","description":"Skills: PHP Frameworks \u00b7 Computer Science","duration":"3 mos","end_month":"","end_year":"","is_current":true,"job_type":"Contract","location":"Remote","skills":"PHP Frameworks \u00b7 Computer Science","start_month":6,"start_year":2024,"title":"Full-stack Developer (MySql, PhP, Bootstrap and JQuery)"},{"company":"Numerox Conglomerate","company_id":"87392241","company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/87392241","company_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHWrhH-uBEANw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1668649765196/numerox_conglomerate_logo?e=1731542400&v=beta&t=TaPIxOs-SuG3j2CUUWOtT8DnDNbMjzA-uHn1Dw2gmhQ","date_range":"Nov 2022 - Present","description":"Numerox Conglomerate is a holding company for five separate businesses with different products and service lines.
